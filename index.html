        <p>Hello! My name is Tinashe Mhike. I am originally from Zimbabwe but moved to South Africa in 2010 when I was
            16 years old. I’m married and a proud father of two boys. I enjoy watching soccer and movies in my free
            time. I currently work as a Financial Controller, but I have a strong interest in software design and
            development—particularly web design. The idea of creating a website from scratch really excites me, and I am
            looking forward to learning and growing through this course.</p>
